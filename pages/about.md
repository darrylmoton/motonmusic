## What This Collection Is...

This is a collection of images and audio files that, when complete, will constitute the entire musical output of Darryl Moton, both individually as Darryl Zero, I Will, In Haze And Bliss, and They Can't See Me, and as members of groups. 

This site is generated using [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/), a project to create a free and simple digital collection using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from: 

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPG images or PDF documents
